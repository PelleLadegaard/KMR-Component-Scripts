## About

A library of component scripts created for the game Knights and Merchants Remake (https://www.kamremake.com/).

These scripts intend to extend gameplay features or provide script utilties. The scripts can be included in a map script by placing the script file in the folder of the map, and then placing this line of code at the top of the map script: `{$I <FILENAME>.script}`

More information about scripting in KaM Remake can be found here: https://github.com/reyandme/kam_remake/wiki

The library currently consists out of these component scripts:
