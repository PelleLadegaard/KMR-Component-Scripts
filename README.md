## About

A library of component scripts created for the game Knights and Merchants Remake (https://www.kamremake.com/).

These scripts intend to extend gameplay features or provide script utilties. The scripts can be included in a map script by placing the script file in the folder of the map, and then placing this line of code at the top of the map script: `{$I <FILENAME>.script}`

The library currently consists of these component scripts:

File | Description
--- | ---
Cmp_ResShare | This component script adds a gameplay feature where players can create a warehouse that shares resources with other team members.
